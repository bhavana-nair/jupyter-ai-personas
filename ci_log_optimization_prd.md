# Product Requirements Document: CI Log Optimization

## 1. Issue Reference
- **Repository**: jupyter-ai-contrib/jupyter-ai-personas
- **Issue Number**: 9
- **Issue Title**: [FEATURE] Optimize CI log handling for memory and context efficiency

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Situation
The existing `fetch_ci_failures` function downloads and processes complete CI logs as raw text, leading to significant inefficiencies in the system.

### Impact Areas
1. **System Performance**
   - High memory usage from loading large CI logs (multiple MB per log)
   - Slow processing times due to handling complete log files
   - Excessive storage requirements for temporary log data

2. **Cost & Resource Utilization**
   - Increased LLM API costs from processing unnecessary log content
   - Inefficient use of context window limits in LLMs
   - Wasted computational resources on irrelevant log sections

3. **User Experience**
   - Slower response times for PR reviews
   - Potential system failures due to memory constraints
   - Limited effectiveness of LLM analysis due to context window restrictions

### Stakeholders
- PR Review Persona users
- System administrators
- Development team
- Cost management team

## 3. Solution Overview

### High-Level Approach
Implement an intelligent log processing system that optimizes the handling of CI logs through compression, selective extraction, and smart filtering.

### Key Components
1. **Compressed Log Handler**
   - Interface with GitHub's compressed log artifacts API
   - Manage temporary file storage for compressed logs
   - Handle decompression and cleanup

2. **Log Content Analyzer**
   - Parse and identify relevant sections of CI logs
   - Extract failure-related content and context
   - Filter and prioritize log content

3. **Memory Management System**
   - Implement streaming processing for large logs
   - Manage temporary file lifecycle
   - Optimize memory usage during processing

## 4. Functional Requirements

### Log Retrieval & Storage
1. Download compressed log artifacts when available
2. Fall back to standard log retrieval when compressed artifacts aren't available
3. Implement secure temporary file handling
4. Automatic cleanup of temporary files

### Log Processing
1. Extract relevant sections from CI logs:
   - Error messages
   - Stack traces
   - Build failure information
   - Critical warnings
   - Relevant context lines (before/after errors)

### Content Filtering
1. Implement smart filtering algorithms to identify:
   - Error patterns
   - Exception stacks
   - Build failure messages
   - Relevant debug information

### System Integration
1. Seamless integration with existing PR review workflow
2. Compatible with current LLM processing pipeline
3. Support for various CI log formats

## 5. Technical Requirements

### Architecture Requirements
1. **Modularity**
   - Separate components for log retrieval, processing, and analysis

   - Processing time: < 30 seconds for typical log file
   - Temporary storage limit: 1GB

3. **Security**
   - Secure handling of temporary files
   - Proper cleanup of sensitive log data
   - Access control for log processing

### Integration Requirements
