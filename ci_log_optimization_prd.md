# Product Requirements Document: CI Log Handling Optimization

## 1. Issue Reference
- **Repository**: jupyter-ai-contrib/jupyter-ai-personas
- **Issue Number**: 9
- **Title**: [FEATURE] Optimize CI log handling for memory and context efficiency
- **Status**: Open
- **Labels**: enhancement

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Situation
The existing `fetch_ci_failures` function downloads and processes complete CI logs as raw text, leading to significant inefficiencies in the system.

### Impact Assessment
1. **Technical Impact**
   - Excessive memory consumption from multi-megabyte log files
   - Context window limitations in LLM processing
   - Degraded system performance due to large data processing
   
2. **Business Impact**
   - Increased operational costs from unnecessary LLM API usage
   - Reduced efficiency in PR review processes
   - Potential system stability issues from memory constraints

### Affected Stakeholders
- Development teams using PR Review Persona
- DevOps teams managing CI processes
- System administrators monitoring resource usage
- Project managers overseeing operational costs

## 3. Solution Overview

### High-Level Approach
Implement an intelligent log processing system that efficiently handles CI logs through compressed artifacts and smart content filtering.

### Key Components
1. **Compressed Log Handler**
   - Integration with GitHub's compressed log artifacts API
   - Temporary file management system
   - Compression/decompression utilities

2. **Smart Log Processor**
   - Content extraction engine
   - Pattern matching system for relevant content
   - Context preservation logic

3. **Memory Management System**
   - Streaming processing capabilities
   - Buffer management
   - Resource cleanup mechanisms

### Technical Considerations
- Compatibility with existing CI systems
- Impact on current API consumers
- Storage requirements for temporary files
- Thread safety and concurrent processing
