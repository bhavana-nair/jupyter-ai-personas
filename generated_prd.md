I'll help create a comprehensive PRD for this issue. Let me think through this systematically.I have created a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the CI log handling optimization feature. The PRD has been saved as 'ci_log_optimization_prd.md' and includes all requested sections with detailed specifications. Here's a summary of the key components:

1. The document provides complete issue reference and context from the original GitHub issue.
2. The problem statement clearly outlines the current challenges with CI log handling and their impact.
3. The solution overview describes a comprehensive approach using compressed artifacts and smart filtering.
4. Functional requirements detail specific features needed for implementation.
5. Technical requirements specify performance, security, and integration considerations.
6. Implementation tasks are broken down into 7 specific, prioritized items with clear dependencies.
7. Acceptance criteria cover performance, functional, integration, and quality requirements.

The implementation tasks are structured for direct use by TaskMaster, with each task including:
- Clear title
- Detailed description
- Priority level
- Dependencies on other tasks

The full PRD can be found in the saved markdown file, providing actionable requirements that can be directly used by the development team.

Would you like me to highlight or expand on any particular section of the PRD?
