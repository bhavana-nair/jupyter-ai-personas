# PR Creation Persona

A specialized AI assistant for analyzing GitHub issues and implementing code fixes with automated git operations.

## Overview

The PR Creation Persona coordinates a team of specialized agents to:
1. **Analyze Issues** - Parse requirements and understand scope
2. **Design Architecture** - Plan minimal solution architecture  
3. **Implement Code** - Write focused code that addresses the issue
4. **Manage Git Operations** - Handle cloning, branching, committing, and pushing

## Key Features

### Clear Task Separation
- **Issue Analysis Agent**: Parses requirements and analyzes repository context
- **Architecture Designer**: Plans implementation strategy and file changes
- **Code Implementer**: Writes minimal, focused code following existing patterns
- **Git Manager**: Handles all git operations including branch creation and pushing

### Repository Context Awareness
- Uses knowledge graph analysis to understand codebase structure
- Identifies existing patterns and conventions
- Analyzes dependencies and relationships
- Finds similar implementations for reference

### Minimal Code Implementation
- Writes only the absolute minimum code needed
- Follows existing code patterns and style
- Focuses specifically on issue requirements
- Avoids verbose or unnecessary implementations

### Complete Git Workflow
- Uses Agno's ShellTools for git operations
- Clones main branch automatically
- Creates descriptive feature branches
- Commits changes with clear messages
- Pushes to remote branch (does NOT create PR)

## Usage

Provide an issue description along with a GitHub repository URL:

```
Analyze this issue and implement a fix:

Repository: https://github.com/user/repo
Issue: Add validation to user input in the login form to prevent SQL injection

The login form currently accepts any input without validation...
```

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Issue Analysis
- Extracts issue requirements and acceptance criteria
- Uses KG queries to understand repository structure
- Identifies affected components and files
- Assesses scope and complexity

### Phase 2: Architecture Design
- Designs minimal solution architecture
- Plans file structure and organization
- Defines implementation strategy
- Creates detailed file-by-file changes plan

### Phase 3: Code Implementation
- Uses Agno's ShellTools and FileTools
- Sets up repository and creates feature branch
- Implements code following the architecture plan
- Writes minimal, focused code addressing the issue
- Maintains consistency with existing patterns

### Phase 4: Git Operations
- Uses standard git commands via ShellTools
- Commits changes with descriptive messages
- Pushes feature branch to remote repository
- Provides branch information for manual PR creation
- Does NOT automatically create pull requests

## Requirements

- GitHub personal access token in `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable
- Neo4j database running on `neo4j://127.0.0.1:7687`
- AWS credentials configured for Bedrock access

## Output

The persona provides:
- Detailed issue analysis and requirements
- Solution architecture and implementation plan
- Code implementation with explanations
- Git operations summary with branch information
- Instructions for manual PR creation

## Integration

The persona integrates with:
- **Knowledge Graph**: For codebase analysis and context
- **GitHub API**: For repository access and metadata
- **Agno ShellTools**: For git operations and command execution
- **Agno FileTools**: For code creation and modification

## Best Practices

- Always analyzes repository context before implementation
- Maintains clear separation between analysis and implementation
- Writes minimal, focused code addressing specific issues
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- Provides complete git workflow without creating PRs
- Ensures proper error handling and validation
